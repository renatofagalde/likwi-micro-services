How to Do a Clean Restart of a Docker Instance
If you are using Docker-Machine, make sure your are talking to the right one. Execute the command docker-machine ls to find which one is currently active. It is also recommended to always redo the command:
eval "$(docker-machine env <docker machine name>)"
Note: Deleting volumes will wipe out their data. Back up any data that you need before deleting a container.
Procedure
Stop the container(s) using the following command:
docker-compose down
Delete all containers using the following command:
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
Delete all volumes using the following command:
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
Restart the containers using the following command:
docker-compose up -d
